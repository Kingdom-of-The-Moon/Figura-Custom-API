# Info

This is an example API, to run with Figura mod!

Feel free to use this as example for your APIs

# Figura

Figura is a Minecraft Java mod that allows you to change your player _extensively_

With **Blockbench** models and **Lua** scripting, Figura is capable of doing almost anything you have in mind

Figura works both Singleplayer and Multiplayer, we have a custom server where your avatar is saved, so anyone using the mod could also see it

But having other people might be a concern, if you think someone is cheating or an avatar is too complex for your framerate?
you can filter those people and tweak their avatar available resources using a system called **trust settings**

**Note:** All avatars rights are reserved to their respective creators
